This package provides tools for array signal processing, with a focus on seismic data. In addition to the classical array processing tools (e.g. beaforming, inter-station cross-correlation) we provide various tools for source detection and location with blind source separation algorithms. The project also includes diverse spectral analysis tools. `covseisnet` mostly inherits from `obpsy` (seismic-data analysis) and `numpy`.
