Beamforming
===========

Using the correlation matrix, beamforming can be done to calculate the likelihood function. This is useful for locating the source of signals such as tremors and tectonic earthquakes.

Another useful product to have is the network response function, which is a 1-D product generated from the 3-D likelihood function.
